## Introduction

YASGUI is a comprehensive SPARQL query interface that combines a powerful query editor (YASQE) with a versatile results viewer (YASR). Whether you're new to SPARQL or an experienced user, YASGUI provides an intuitive interface for working with semantic data.

**Key Benefits:**

- Write and execute SPARQL queries against any endpoint
- Visualize results in multiple formats (tables, graphs, maps, etc.)
- Save and manage multiple query tabs
- Auto-complete and syntax highlighting
- Theme support (light and dark modes)
- Responsive layouts for different screen sizes

---

## What is SPARQL?

**SPARQL** (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is the standard query language for retrieving and manipulating data stored in RDF (Resource Description Framework) format. Think of it as SQL for linked data and knowledge graphs.

### Basic Concepts

- **Triples**: RDF data is organized as subject-predicate-object statements
- **URIs**: Resources are identified using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)
- **Prefixes**: Shortcuts for long URIs (e.g., `foaf:` for `http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/`)
- **Endpoints**: Web services that accept SPARQL queries

### Learning SPARQL

For a comprehensive, beginner-friendly guide to SPARQL, visit:
**[https://kvistgaard.github.io/sparql/](https://kvistgaard.github.io/sparql/)**

This excellent resource covers:

- SPARQL syntax and structure
- Query types (SELECT, CONSTRUCT, ASK, DESCRIBE)
- Filters and functions
- Real-world examples and exercises

### Common SPARQL Query Types

- **SELECT**: Returns a table of results (like SQL SELECT)
- **CONSTRUCT**: Creates new RDF triples from query results
- **ASK**: Returns true/false for whether a pattern exists
- **DESCRIBE**: Returns all information about a resource

---

## Getting Started

### Accessing YASGUI

YASGUI is available at: **[https://yasgui.matdata.eu/](https://yasgui.matdata.eu/)**

### Running YASGUI with Docker

You can run YASGUI locally using Docker, which is especially useful when working with local SPARQL endpoints.

**Why Use Docker?**

- Avoids browser mixed content restrictions when querying local endpoints
- No need to grant browser permissions for local network access
- Self-contained environment with all dependencies included
- Easy to set up and run

**Running YASGUI:**

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 mathiasvda/yasgui
```

This command:

- Downloads the YASGUI Docker image (first run only)
- Starts YASGUI on port 8080
- Makes it accessible at `http://localhost:8080`

**Accessing YASGUI:**

- Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8080`
- YASGUI will load and be ready to use
- You can now query local endpoints without browser permission prompts

**Benefits for Local Endpoints:**

- Both YASGUI and your local endpoint use HTTP (no mixed content issues)
- No browser security prompts
- Seamless connection to localhost services
- See [Querying Local Endpoints](#querying-local-endpoints) for more details

**Stopping YASGUI:**

- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where Docker is running
- Or use: `docker stop <container-id>`

**Custom Port:**
To run on a different port (e.g., 3000):

```bash
docker run -p 3000:8080 mathiasvda/yasgui
```

Then access at `http://localhost:3000`

### Your First Query

1. **Select an Endpoint**: Enter a SPARQL endpoint URL in the endpoint field (or use the default)
2. **Write a Query**: Type your SPARQL query in the editor
3. **Execute**: Click the "Execute" button or press `Ctrl+Enter`
4. **View Results**: Results appear in the results viewer below

**Example Query:**

```sparql
SELECT ?subject ?predicate ?object
WHERE {
  ?subject ?predicate ?object
}
LIMIT 10
```

### Saving Your Work

YASGUI automatically saves:

- Your queries in local storage
- Tab configurations
- User preferences (theme, layout, etc.)

Your work persists across browser sessions on the same device.

### Querying Local Endpoints

YASGUI can query SPARQL endpoints running on your local machine (e.g., Apache Jena Fuseki, GraphDB). However, browsers require special permission to access local servers from web applications.

**Steps to Query Local Endpoints:**

1. **Enter Local Endpoint URL**: Add your local endpoint to the endpoint input box
   - Example: `http://localhost:3030/g/`
   - Example: `http://127.0.0.1:3030/dataset/query`

2. **Execute Your Query**: Click Execute or press `Ctrl+Enter`

3. **Grant Browser Permission**: Your browser will show a permission request to access the local endpoint

   **In Microsoft Edge:**

   ![Permission request dialog](img/local_endpoint_msedge_permission_request.png)
   - Click **"Allow"** to grant permission
   - The permission applies for the domain on which you run yasgui (for example https://yasgui.matdata.eu/)

4. **If You Blocked the Request**: You can change the permission later

   ![Change permission settings](img/local_endpoint_msedge_permission_change.png)
   - Click the lock icon in the address bar
   - Find the "Local network access" or similar setting
   - Change it to "Allow"
   - Execute the query again

5. **Permission Denied Error**: If same-origin policy was not accepted, you'll see an error

   ![Permission denied error](img/local_endpoint_msedge_error.png)
   - Follow step 4 to grant permission
   - Re-execute your query

**Other Browsers:**

The process is similar in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari:

- Chrome: the same as Edge (verified by author)
- Firefox: May require setting `security.mixed_content.block_active_content` to false in about:config (unverified by author)
- Safari: Check "Disable local file restrictions" in Develop menu (unverified by author)
- Vivaldi: the same as Edge (verified by author)

**Alternative: Use Docker to Avoid Permission Issues**

If you frequently work with local endpoints, consider running YASGUI locally with Docker:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 mathiasvda/yasgui
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

This eliminates browser permission prompts since both YASGUI and your local endpoint use HTTP. See [Running YASGUI with Docker](#running-yasgui-with-docker) for details.

**Important Notes:**

- Permission is required because YASGUI is served over HTTPS while your local endpoint uses HTTP
- This is a browser security feature to protect against mixed content attacks
- You'll need to grant permission once and it should apply for all browser session (when you don't clear cache & settings)
- Consider using HTTPS for your local endpoint for automatic permission

**Troubleshooting Local Endpoints:**

- Ensure your local SPARQL server is running before querying
- Check that the port number is correct (e.g., 3030, 3333, 7200)
- Verify the endpoint path matches your server configuration
- See [Troubleshooting - Local Endpoint Issues](#local-endpoint-issues) for more help

You can preview all available themes at [CodeMirror's theme demo page](https://codemirror.net/5/demo/theme.html).

Your theme preferences are stored separately for light and dark modes, so switching between app themes (light/dark) will automatically apply the appropriate editor theme.

**System Theme Detection:**

If you haven't manually selected a theme, YASGUI will:

1. Check your system's color scheme preference
2. Apply dark theme if your system prefers dark mode
3. Apply light theme otherwise
4. Automatically update if you change your system preference

### Layout Orientation

YASGUI offers two layout options to optimize screen space:

**Vertical Layout (Default):**

- Query editor on top
- Results viewer below
- Best for standard monitors and laptops

**Horizontal Layout:**

- Query editor on left
- Results viewer on right (side-by-side)
- Ideal for wide/ultrawide monitors
- Maximizes vertical space for both components

**How to Change Layout:**

- Click the layout toggle button in the control bar (next to the endpoint selector)
- Icon shows stacked rectangles (vertical) or side-by-side rectangles (horizontal)
- Layout preference is saved automatically

### Query Formatting

Keep your SPARQL queries clean and readable with automatic formatting.

**Features:**

- Format button in the editor toolbar
- Keyboard shortcut: `Shift+Ctrl+F`
- Choice of formatting engines:
  - **sparql-formatter** (default): Standards-compliant, modern formatter
  - **Legacy formatter**: Original YASGUI formatter
- Auto-format on query execution (configurable in Settings)

**How to Format:**

1. Write or paste your query
2. Click the format button or press `Shift+Ctrl+F`
3. Query is automatically reformatted with proper indentation and spacing

**Configuration:**

- Open Settings (⚙ icon) to:
  - Select your preferred formatter
  - Enable/disable auto-format on query execution
  - Both settings are saved persistently

### CONSTRUCT Query Validation

YASGUI helps you write correct CONSTRUCT queries by detecting undefined variables.

**Feature:**

- Automatically checks if variables used in the CONSTRUCT template are defined in the WHERE clause
- Shows orange warning markers in the gutter for undefined variables
- Displays tooltips explaining which variable is undefined
- Does not prevent query execution (informational only)

**How It Works:**
When you write a CONSTRUCT query, YASGUI analyzes the variables:

```sparql
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/>
CONSTRUCT {
  ?s ex:hasName ?name .
  ?s ex:hasAge ?age .      # ⚠️ Warning: ?age not defined in WHERE
}
WHERE {
  ?s ex:name ?name .       # Only ?s and ?name are defined
}
```

**Visual Feedback:**

- **Orange warning icon**: Appears in the gutter next to lines with undefined variables
- **Tooltip**: Hover over the warning icon to see which variable is undefined
- **Non-blocking**: Queries can still be executed even with warnings

**Configuration:**

- Open Settings (⚙ icon) → Editor tab
- Toggle "Validate CONSTRUCT query variables" checkbox
- Enabled by default
- Setting is saved persistently

**Why This Helps:**

- Catch typos in variable names early
- Ensure CONSTRUCT queries will produce expected results
- Understand which variables are actually bound in your query
- Improve query quality without blocking execution

### Code Snippets

Quickly insert common SPARQL patterns and query types using the code snippets bar.

**Features:**

- **Quick insertion**: Click a snippet button to insert code at your cursor position
- **Default snippets**: Includes 5 useful SPARQL snippets (SELECT, CONSTRUCT, ASK, FILTER, OPTIONAL)
- **Dropdown grouping**: When more than 10 snippets are configured, they are grouped in dropdown menus
- **Customizable**: Developers can configure custom snippets
- **Visibility toggle**: Show or hide the snippets bar based on preference

**How to Use:**

1. Position your cursor where you want to insert code
2. Click a snippet button in the snippets bar (above the editor)
3. The code is inserted at your cursor position
4. Continue editing as needed

**Default Snippets:**

- **SELECT**: Basic SELECT query template
- **CONSTRUCT**: CONSTRUCT query template
- **ASK**: ASK query template
- **FILTER**: FILTER pattern example
- **OPTIONAL**: OPTIONAL pattern template

**Grouped Snippets (>10):**
When more than 10 snippets are configured, they are organized into dropdown menus by group:

- Click a group button (e.g., "Query Types", "Patterns") to open the dropdown
- Click a snippet in the dropdown to insert it
- The dropdown closes automatically after insertion

**Configuration:**

- Snippets bar visibility is saved in user preferences
- Developers can configure custom snippets with label, code, and group properties
- The bar is hidden automatically when no snippets are configured

### Fullscreen Mode

Maximize screen space for editing or viewing results.

**Available Modes:**

- **YASQE Fullscreen**: Editor takes up the entire screen
- **YASR Fullscreen**: Results viewer takes up the entire screen

**How to Use:**

- Press `F11` to toggle YASQE fullscreen
- Press `F10` to toggle YASR fullscreen
- Press `F9` to switch between YASQE and YASR fullscreen
- Press `Esc` or click the close button to exit fullscreen

### Prefix Management

Simplify query writing with reusable prefix declarations.

**Features:**

- **Saved Prefixes**: Define commonly-used prefixes once, reuse everywhere
- **Auto-capture**: YASGUI automatically captures new prefixes from your queries
- **PREFIX Button**: Insert saved prefixes into your query with one click
- **Prefix Autocomplete**: Type a prefix (e.g., `PREFIX foaf:`) and YASGUI suggests the full URI from prefix.cc

**Default Prefixes:**
YASGUI includes standard prefixes like:

- `rdf:` - RDF vocabulary
- `rdfs:` - RDF Schema

**How to Use:**

1. Click the "PREFIX" button to insert all saved prefixes
2. Open Settings (⚙) to manage your prefix collection
3. Enable/disable auto-capture in Settings

**Auto-completion:**
When typing a prefix declaration, YASGUI queries [prefix.cc](https://prefix.cc) to suggest standard URIs:

```sparql
PREFIX foaf: <  # Auto-suggests http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/
```

### Endpoint Quick Switch

The endpoint quick switch buttons feature allows you to quickly switch between different SPARQL endpoints with a single click. You can use predefined endpoints or add your own custom buttons.

**Features:**

- **One-click switching**: Instantly switch to a different SPARQL endpoint
- **Developer-configured buttons**: Administrators can configure endpoint buttons during initialization
- **User-configurable buttons**: Enable/disable developer-configured buttons or add your own
- **Persistent storage**: Custom buttons and preferences are saved in local storage
- **Fully themed**: Buttons automatically adapt to light and dark themes
- **Accessible**: Buttons are fully accessible with ARIA labels

**Developer-Configured Endpoint Buttons:**

If the developer has configured endpoint buttons when initializing YASGUI, you can manage them through the Settings interface:

1. Click the Settings button (⚙) in the control bar
2. Navigate to the "Endpoints" tab
3. Look for the "Developer-Configured Endpoint Buttons" section at the top
4. Toggle the "Enabled" checkbox for each button to show or hide it

This allows you to customize which developer-configured buttons appear in your toolbar without losing the configuration.

**How to Add Custom Endpoints:**

1. Click the Settings button (⚙) in the control bar
2. Navigate to the "Endpoints" tab
3. Scroll to the "SPARQL Endpoints" section
4. Enter an endpoint URL in the "Add New Endpoint" field
5. Click "+ Add Endpoint"
6. Optionally add a label and enable "Show as Button"
7. Changes are saved automatically

Custom endpoint configurations persist across browser sessions. You can delete endpoints by clicking the "Delete" button.

**How to Switch Endpoints:**

- Buttons are displayed next to the endpoint textbox in the control bar
- Click any endpoint button to immediately update the endpoint field
- The endpoint change triggers the same behavior as manually entering an endpoint
- The new endpoint is used for all subsequent queries

**Overflow Dropdown for Limited Space:**
When the control bar is too narrow to display all endpoint buttons (e.g., when resizing the window or having many endpoints), buttons that don't fit are automatically grouped into an overflow dropdown menu:

- A "more" button (⋯) appears at the end of the visible buttons
- Click the overflow button to reveal a dropdown with the hidden endpoint buttons
- The dropdown automatically adjusts as you resize the window
- All endpoint buttons remain accessible even in constrained spaces
- The overflow button only appears when needed and stays visible as long as there is room for it

**Behavior:**

- Clicking a button updates the endpoint textbox with the configured endpoint
- The endpoint change is immediate and doesn't require confirmation
- Multiple buttons can be displayed for different endpoints
- Each button shows its label for easy identification

### Configuration Import/Export

Backup, share, and migrate your YASGUI configuration using RDF Turtle format. This feature allows you to export all your settings, tabs, queries, and preferences, then import them on another device or browser.

**Features:**

- **Export to file**: Download your configuration as a `.ttl` file

- **Import from file**: Upload a previously exported configuration
- **Paste from clipboard**: Import configuration directly from clipboard
- **Drag & drop**: Drop a `.ttl` file to import configuration
- **RDF/Turtle format**: Standard, semantic format for configuration data

**Configuration Ontology:**

YASGUI uses a custom RDF ontology to represent configuration:

- Namespace: `https://yasgui.matdata.eu/ontology#`
- Classes: `Configuration`, `Tab`
- Properties: `activeTab`, `prefixes`, `endpoint`, `query`, `tabName`, etc.

**What Gets Exported:**

- All query tabs and their content
- Endpoint configurations
- Saved prefixes
- Custom endpoint buttons
- Auto-capture settings
- Editor preferences

**How to Export Configuration:**

1. Click the Settings button (⚙) in the control bar
2. Navigate to the "Import/Export" tab
3. Choose export method:
   - **📋 Copy to Clipboard**: Copies configuration as RDF Turtle text
   - **💾 Download as File**: Downloads as `yasgui-config.ttl`
4. Share the file or clipboard content with others, or save it for backup

**How to Import Configuration:**

1. Click the Settings button (⚙) in the control bar
2. Navigate to the "Import/Export" tab
3. Choose import method:
   - **Drag & drop**: Drag a `.ttl` file onto the drop zone
   - **📂 Browse Files**: Click to select a file from your computer
   - **📋 Paste from Clipboard**: Import directly from clipboard
4. Confirm the import when prompted
5. Reload the page to see the imported configuration

**Example Configuration (RDF Turtle):**

```turtle
@prefix yasgui: <https://yasgui.matdata.eu/ontology#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

[] a yasgui:Configuration ;
  yasgui:activeTab "tab1" ;
  yasgui:prefixes """PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>""" ;
  yasgui:autoCaptureEnabled "true"^^xsd:boolean ;
  yasgui:tab [
    yasgui:tabId "tab1" ;
    yasgui:tabName "My Query" ;
    yasgui:query "SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 10" ;
    yasgui:endpoint "https://dbpedia.org/sparql" ;
    yasgui:requestMethod "POST"
  ] .
```

**Use Cases:**

- **Backup**: Export configuration before clearing browser data
- **Migration**: Move your setup to a different browser or device
- **Sharing**: Share query collections with colleagues
- **Version Control**: Track configuration changes over time
- **Collaboration**: Distribute standardized query setups to teams

**Important Notes:**

- Import will replace your current configuration (confirm before proceeding)
- Page reload is required to fully apply imported configuration
- Configuration is stored in browser's local storage
- Export includes all tabs and queries, but not query execution results

### URI Explorer

Quickly explore RDF resources by Ctrl+clicking on URIs in your query.

**How It Works:**

1. Hold `Ctrl` and click any URI in the query editor
2. YASGUI automatically generates and executes a CONSTRUCT query exploring:
   - Outgoing triples (where the URI is the subject)
   - Incoming triples (where the URI is the object)
3. Results appear without modifying your original query
4. View the resource's connections in the results viewer

**Example:**
Ctrl+clicking on `http://dbpedia.org/resource/European_Union` automatically queries for all triples related to the European Union.

### Query Tabs

Manage multiple queries simultaneously with tabs.

**Features:**

- Create unlimited query tabs
- Rename tabs by double-clicking the tab name
- Duplicate tabs to create query variations
- Reorder tabs by dragging
- Close individual tabs
- Each tab maintains its own:
  - Query content
  - Endpoint configuration
  - Results
  - Plugin selection

**Tab Operations:**

- **New Tab**: Click the "+" button in the tab bar
- **Rename**: Double-click the tab name
- **Duplicate**: Right-click and select "Duplicate"
- **Close**: Click the "×" on the tab or use the context menu
- **Reorder**: Drag and drop tabs to rearrange

- Authorization Endpoint: The OAuth provider's authorization URL
- Token Endpoint: The OAuth provider's token exchange URL
- Redirect URI: Callback URL (optional, defaults to current page)
- Scope: Space-separated OAuth scopes (optional)
- Use case: Secure, industry-standard authorization with automatic token refresh
- **Process**: Click "Save & Authenticate" to open OAuth login window
- **⚠️ Important**: The redirect URI must be registered with your OAuth provider by the OAuth administrator before authentication will work

⚠️ **Important Security Notes:**

- **Credentials are stored in browser localStorage**: Your authentication credentials are stored locally in your browser
- **Only use with HTTPS endpoints**: Never send credentials to HTTP endpoints as they will be transmitted in plain text
- **Be cautious on shared computers**: Clear your browser data when using YASGUI on shared or public computers
- **OAuth 2.0 tokens**: Access tokens are automatically refreshed when expired (if refresh token is available)
- **Token security**: OAuth 2.0 uses secure PKCE flow (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security

**How Authentication Works:**

Authentication is stored per-endpoint, which means:

- All tabs using the same endpoint share the same credentials
- You only need to configure authentication once per endpoint
- Credentials persist across browser sessions (stored in localStorage)

When authentication is configured:

For **Basic Authentication**:

1. YASGUI encodes your credentials using Base64 encoding
2. Adds an `Authorization` header with the format: `Basic <encoded-credentials>`
3. Sends this header with every SPARQL query request to that endpoint

For **Bearer Token**:

1. Uses the provided token as-is
2. Adds an `Authorization` header with the format: `Bearer <token>`
3. Sends this header with every SPARQL query request to that endpoint

For **API Key**:

1. Uses the specified custom header name and API key value
2. Adds a custom header with the format: `<Header-Name>: <api-key>`
3. Sends this header with every SPARQL query request to that endpoint

For **OAuth 2.0**:

1. Opens a popup window for OAuth provider authentication
2. Uses Authorization Code flow with PKCE for secure token exchange
3. Stores access token and refresh token
4. Automatically checks token expiration before each query
5. Automatically refreshes expired tokens using refresh token (if available)
6. Adds an `Authorization` header with the format: `Bearer <access-token>`
7. If token refresh fails, prompts user to re-authenticate

**OAuth 2.0 Provider Examples:**

**⚠️ Important Prerequisite:**
Before using OAuth 2.0, the OAuth administrator must register the redirect URI (callback URL) in the OAuth provider's configuration. By default, YASGUI uses the current page URL as the redirect URI. For example, if YASGUI is hosted at `https://yasgui.example.com/`, this URL must be added to the allowed redirect URIs in your OAuth application settings.

_Microsoft Azure (Entra ID):_

- Authorization Endpoint: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`
- Token Endpoint: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/token`
- Scope: `api://your-app-id/.default` or `openid profile`
- Note: Your app must be registered in Azure AD with public client flow enabled
- **Redirect URI Registration**: Add your YASGUI URL to "Redirect URIs" in Azure AD app registration

_AWS Cognito:_

- Authorization Endpoint: `https://your-domain.auth.region.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/authorize`
- Token Endpoint: `https://your-domain.auth.region.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token`
- Scope: `openid profile` (adjust as needed)
- Note: Enable "Authorization code grant" flow in your app client settings
- **Redirect URI Registration**: Add your YASGUI URL to "Allowed callback URLs" in Cognito app client settings

_Keycloak:_

- Authorization Endpoint: `https://your-keycloak-domain.com/realms/{realm-name}/protocol/openid-connect/auth`
- Token Endpoint: `https://your-keycloak-domain.com/realms/{realm-name}/protocol/openid-connect/token`
- Scope: `openid profile` (adjust based on client configuration)
- Note: Client should have "Standard Flow" enabled and "Access Type" set to "public"
- **Redirect URI Registration**: Add your YASGUI URL to "Valid Redirect URIs" in Keycloak client configuration

### Managed Queries and Workspaces

YASGUI can be configured with **managed-queries and workspaces**, which provide a shared, versioned store for SPARQL queries (for example in Git or in an RDF store). A managed query is the name of a query that is saved in a workspace. A workspace can be linked to a git or sparql backand, is setup by the user and is required before queries can be saved.

#### Workspaces

**Configure workspaces:**

1. Open **Settings** (⚙) for a tab
2. Go to the **Workspaces** tab
3. Add one or more workspaces (Git or SPARQL) and choose a **Default workspace**
4. (Optional) Click **Validate access** to test the configuration

Note: the recommended type of workspace is SPARQL. It is more feature rich (allows to save endpoints and descriptions) and is much faster. The Git based workspace uses HTTP calls to the Git provider API, several calls are required to read/write queries, which makes it slower.

##### SPARQL workspaces

**Configuration fields:**

- **SPARQL endpoint**: which endpoint to use for reading/writing the workspace data. This is selected from your configured endpoints (including any auth headers you set up for that endpoint).
- **Workspace IRI**: the IRI that identifies the workspace in the RDF store (the `yasgui:Workspace` / SKOS concept scheme).
  - You can **reuse an existing** workspace IRI to point to already-stored managed queries.
  - Or choose a **new** workspace IRI to start a fresh workspace.
- **Default graph (optional)**: the named graph to read/write workspace data in (sent as `default-graph-uri`). Leave empty to use the store’s default dataset behavior.

**URI minting strategy:**

In SPARQL-based workspaces, YASGUI assigns **immutable identifiers** (URIs) to managed queries and their versions.
This is important because users can rename queries (and query names can change over time), but the **identity** of a managed query should remain stable.

- Managed query URI: `<workspaceIri>_mq_<uuid>`
- Managed query version URI: `<workspaceIri>_mq_v_<uuid>`

Notes:

- The base is always the workspace URI (`workspaceIri`), followed by `_mq_` or `_mq_v_`, then a UUID.
- The URI does **not** include the query name
- Renaming a query changes its `rdfs:label`, not its URI.
- Versions are immutable snapshots linked via `dcterms:isVersionOf`.

**Tip: local Apache Jena/Fuseki endpoint (Docker)**

If you want a quick local SPARQL endpoint to test with, you can run a Fuseki server with GeoSPARQL support:

```sh
docker run -p 3030:3030 mathiasvda/apache-jena-fuseki-geosparql
```

Then configure YASGUI to use the endpoint URL:

`http://localhost:3030/ds/`

**Limitations / notes:**

- If the SPARQL endpoint is blocked by browser **CORS** policies, the workspace may not work without a proxy.

##### Git based workspaces

**Supported providers:**

- **GitHub** (including GitHub Enterprise)
- **GitLab** (GitLab.com and self-hosted)
- **Bitbucket Cloud**
- **Gitea** (self-hosted)

Currently GitHub and GitLab have been thoroughly tested; Bitbucket Cloud and Gitea support covers the same as GitHub/GitLab but have not been extensively tested.

Git workspaces are implemented via the providers' **HTTPS REST APIs**.

- The `remoteUrl` can be `https://...`, `ssh://...`, or SCP-style (e.g. `git@host:org/repo.git`).
- **Important:** SSH/SCP-like remotes are **only parsed** to identify `host` + `owner/repo`. YASGUI does **not** implement Git-over-SSH; all reads/writes still happen through the provider's HTTPS API.

**Configuration fields:**

- **Remote URL**: repository URL (see formats above)
- **Token**: stored locally and never re-displayed after entry
- **Advanced (optional)**:
  - **Provider**: force a specific provider client (otherwise auto-detect)
  - **API base URL**: for enterprise/self-hosted instances (e.g., GitHub Enterprise `.../api/v3`, GitLab `.../api/v4`, Gitea `.../api/v1`)
  - **Branch**: optional; if left empty, the provider default branch is used when possible
  - **Root path**: optional subfolder within the repo
  - **Username**: optional; required by Bitbucket Cloud when using an app password

**Limitations / notes:**

- If the provider API is blocked by browser **CORS** policies, a Git workspace may not work without a proxy.
- Git workspaces store only query text files (`.rq` or `.sparql`); they do not store endpoint associations, so opening a Git-managed query will not auto-switch endpoints.

#### Managed queries

**Browse and open managed queries:**

- Open the **Query Browser** from the per-tab control bar
- Navigate folders and select a query to open it in a new tab
- SPARQL based workspace only: the endpoint is automatically switched to the one saved with the managed query

**Save as managed query:**

- Use the tab context menu action **Save as managed query**
- Saving the same query text does not create a new version; changing text creates a new version

**Credentials:**

- Tokens are stored locally, not saved together with the managed query and are not re-displayed after entry

### Query History and Persistence

YASGUI automatically saves your work locally.

**What's Saved:**

- Query text in each tab
- Tab names and order
- Endpoint configurations
- Last query results
- User preferences (theme, layout, etc.)
- Custom endpoint buttons

**Persistence Duration:**

- Default: 30 days
- Configurable by administrators

**Note:** Data is stored in your browser's local storage. Clearing browser data will remove saved queries.

### Share Queries

Share your queries with colleagues using multiple formats including URL parameters, cURL, PowerShell, and wget commands.

**Share Button:**

YASQE provides a share button (when `createShareableLink` is configured) that offers multiple sharing options:

1. **Copy URL** - Copies the shareable URL to your clipboard
2. **Shorten URL** - Creates a shortened URL (if URL shortener is configured)
3. **Copy cURL** - Generates and copies a cURL command for command-line execution
4. **Copy PowerShell** - Generates and copies a PowerShell command using `Invoke-WebRequest`
5. **Copy wget** - Generates and copies a wget command

**How to Share:**

YASGUI supports URL-based query sharing:

1. Craft your query in YASGUI
2. Click the share button (sharing icon in the top-right corner)
3. Select your preferred format
4. The content is automatically copied to your clipboard
5. Share with others or execute in your terminal

**URL Parameters:**

- `query`: The SPARQL query
- `endpoint`: The endpoint URL
- Other tab configurations

**Command-Line Formats:**

All command-line formats (cURL, PowerShell, wget) include:

- The complete SPARQL query
- All configured headers
- Authentication credentials (if configured)
- Proper HTTP method (GET or POST)

⚠️ **Security Notice:** When copying commands with authentication credentials, a warning notification will appear. Be cautious about sharing these commands as they contain sensitive authentication information.

**Example Formats:**

_cURL:_

```bash
curl 'https://example.com/sparql' \
  --data 'query=SELECT%20...' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer token' \
  -H 'Accept: application/sparql-results+json'
```

_PowerShell:_

```powershell
$params = @{
    Uri = "https://example.com/sparql"
    Method = "Post"
    Headers = @{
        "Accept" = "application/sparql-results+json"
        "Authorization" = "Bearer token"
    }
    ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    Body = "query=SELECT%20..."
    OutFile = "result.json"
}

Invoke-WebRequest @params
```

_wget:_

```bash
wget 'https://example.com/sparql' \
  --body-data 'query=SELECT%20...' \
  --method POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer token' \
  --header 'Accept: application/sparql-results+json' \
  -O -
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Query Not Executing

**Symptoms:**

- Click Execute but nothing happens
- No results appear

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Query Syntax**: Look for red error indicators in the editor
2. **Verify Endpoint**: Ensure the endpoint URL is correct and accessible
3. **Check Browser Console**: Open browser developer tools (F12) for error messages
4. **Check Internet Connection**: Ensure you're online
5. **Try a Simple Query**: Execute a basic query to test the endpoint:
   ```sparql
   SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 1
   ```

#### CORS Errors

**Symptoms:**

- Error message about "Cross-Origin Request Blocked"
- Query works in other tools but not in YASGUI

**Explanation:**
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature. Some SPARQL endpoints don't allow browser-based queries from different domains.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Endpoint CORS Policy**: Contact the endpoint administrator
2. **Use CORS Proxy**: Setup a local hosted CORS proxy (see (#virtuoso-preflight-authentication-issues)) or a remote one (google it)
3. **Use Desktop/Server Version**: Run YASGUI locally or server-side where CORS doesn't apply
4. **Server-Side Proxy**: Query through a backend service
5. **Virtuoso-Specific Issues**: If using Virtuoso 07.20.3242 or earlier with authentication, see [Virtuoso Preflight Authentication Issues](#virtuoso-preflight-authentication-issues)

#### Local Endpoint Issues

**Symptoms:**

- Cannot connect to localhost or 127.0.0.1 endpoints
- "Mixed content blocked" or similar errors
- Permission denied when querying local server

**Explanation:**
Browsers block HTTP requests to local endpoints from HTTPS pages (mixed content policy). This is a security feature to prevent malicious websites from accessing your local services.

**Solutions:**

1. **Run YASGUI Locally with Docker** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 mathiasvda/yasgui
   ```

   - Eliminates all permission issues
   - Both YASGUI and local endpoint use HTTP
   - See [Running YASGUI with Docker](#running-yasgui-with-docker) for details
2. **Grant Browser Permission**:
   - Click "Allow" when the browser prompts for permission
   - See [Querying Local Endpoints](#querying-local-endpoints) for detailed instructions with screenshots
3. **Check Permission Settings**:
   - Click the lock/info icon in the address bar
   - Find "Insecure content" or "Mixed content" setting
   - Change to "Allow" and reload
4. **Verify Local Server is Running**:
   - Open `http://localhost:PORT/` in a new tab
   - Ensure you see your SPARQL endpoint's interface
5. **Check Port Number**: Common SPARQL ports are 3030 (Fuseki), 7200 (GraphDB), 3333 (Blazegraph)
6. **Try 127.0.0.1**: If `localhost` doesn't work, try `http://127.0.0.1:PORT/`
7. **Enable CORS on Local Server**: Configure your SPARQL server to allow CORS requests
8. **Use HTTPS for Local Endpoint**: Set up SSL/TLS on your local server (advanced)
9. **Virtuoso with Authentication**: If using Virtuoso 07.20.3242 or earlier with Basic Authentication, see [Virtuoso Preflight Authentication Issues](#virtuoso-preflight-authentication-issues)

**Browser-Specific Notes:**

- **Edge/Chrome/Vivaldi**: Look for shield icon in address bar to manage blocked content
- **Firefox**: May need to adjust `security.mixed_content.block_active_content` in about:config
- **Safari**: Enable "Disable local file restrictions" in Develop menu

#### Virtuoso Preflight Authentication Issues

**Symptoms:**

- Using Virtuoso 07.20.3242 (and earlier?) with Basic Authentication
- SPARQL queries work from curl/Postman but fail from browser
- Browser shows 401 Unauthorized error on OPTIONS request
- Error occurs before the actual query is sent

**Explanation:**
When querying a SPARQL endpoint with authentication from a web browser, the browser sends a preflight OPTIONS request first (before the actual GET/POST request). This is standard CORS behavior. However, **Virtuoso versions 07.20.3242 and earlier have a bug** where they require authentication for the OPTIONS request, which violates the CORS specification. The browser never sends credentials with OPTIONS requests, so Virtuoso returns a 401 error and blocks the query.

This issue was supposed to be fixed in Virtuoso 08.03.3326 (see [release notes](https://community.openlinksw.com/t/virtuoso-08-03-3326-release-notes/3376): "Fixed OPTIONS is pre-flight; should be 200 w/ CORS headers").

**Solutions:**

**Option 1: Use a Local CORS Proxy** (Recommended for development)

Run a simple proxy server that handles CORS and authentication correctly:

1. **Quick Start with Docker:**

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name simple-cors-proxy -p 8080:8080 mathiasvda/simple-cors-proxy
   ```

2. **Or install from source:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Matdata-eu/simple-cors-proxy.git
   cd simple-cors-proxy
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

   The proxy runs on port 8080 by default.

3. **Configure YASGUI endpoint:**
   - For **local Virtuoso** (running on your machine):
     ```
     http://localhost:8080/proxy/http://host.docker.internal:8890/sparql-auth
     ```
   - For **remote Virtuoso** servers:
     ```
     http://localhost:8080/proxy/https://your-virtuoso-server.com/sparql
     ```

   The proxy URL format is: `http://localhost:8080/proxy/[TARGET_ENDPOINT_URL]`

**Option 2: Upgrade Virtuoso** (Recommended for production)

At the time of writing, the issue was present in the latest Virtuoso Opensource version 07.20.3242. This issue has been raised with OpenLink and hopefully they will patch the proble.

**Option 3: Configure Server-Side URL Rewrite**

If you control the web server in front of Virtuoso, configure it to return 200 OK for OPTIONS requests without authentication. See your web server documentation (Apache, Nginx, IIS) for URL rewrite rules.

**Why This Happens:**

When YASGUI sends an authenticated request from a browser:

1. Browser detects cross-origin request with custom headers (Authorization)
2. Browser sends preflight OPTIONS request (without credentials)
3. Virtuoso incorrectly requires authentication for OPTIONS
4. OPTIONS returns 401, blocking the actual query
5. Your SPARQL query never executes

The proxy solves this by:

- Accepting the OPTIONS request and returning proper CORS headers
- Forwarding only the actual GET/POST requests to Virtuoso with credentials
- Translating between browser CORS requirements and Virtuoso's behavior

**Additional Notes:**

- This issue only affects browser-based queries with authentication
- Command-line tools (curl, Postman) work fine because they don't send OPTIONS
- The issue affects other triple stores with similar CORS/authentication bugs
- The proxy is safe for local development but shouldn't be exposed publicly

#### Slow Queries

**Symptoms:**

- Query takes very long to execute
- Browser becomes unresponsive

**Solutions:**

1. **Add LIMIT Clause**: Restrict result size:
   ```sparql
   SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 100
   ```
2. **Optimize Query**: Make query more specific with filters
3. **Check Endpoint Status**: Endpoint might be under heavy load
4. **Break Into Smaller Queries**: Split complex queries into simpler parts
5. **Use Query Timeout**: Set a reasonable timeout in settings

#### Results Not Displaying Correctly

**Symptoms:**

- Results appear but look wrong
- Visualization doesn't show expected data

**Solutions:**

1. **Try Different Plugin**: Switch between Table, Response, and other plugins
2. **Check Response Plugin**: View raw response to verify data structure
3. **Check Data Format**: Ensure query returns expected format for the plugin
4. **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache and reload YASGUI
5. **Check Browser Compatibility**: Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

#### Autocomplete Not Working

**Symptoms:**

- No suggestions appear when typing
- Ctrl+Space does nothing

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Internet Connection**: Prefix suggestions require network access
2. **Wait for Typing Pause**: Autocomplete appears after a brief delay
3. **Position Cursor Correctly**: Autocomplete context-dependent (prefixes, keywords, etc.)
4. **Manually Trigger**: Press `Ctrl+Space` to force autocomplete
5. **LOV ontology description**: The implementation uses https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/ to retrieve classes and predicates from ontologies. If the ontology that you use cannot be found here, then the autocomplete will not work.

#### Lost Queries

**Symptoms:**

- Previous queries disappeared
- Tabs missing after reload

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Browser Storage**: Ensure browser allows local storage
2. **Avoid Private/Incognito Mode**: These modes don't persist local storage
3. **Check Storage Limits**: Browser might have cleared old data
4. **Export Important Queries**: Save critical queries externally
5. **Use Bookmarks**: Bookmark queries as URLs for safekeeping
6. **Same browser**: Use the same browser and profile to access YASGUI

#### Theme/Layout Not Saving

**Symptoms:**

- Theme reverts to default on reload
- Layout orientation doesn't persist

**Solutions:**

1. **Enable Local Storage**: Check browser settings
2. **Check Private Mode**: Use normal browser mode
3. **Clear and Reset**: Clear browser data, reconfigure preferences
4. **Check Browser Compatibility**: Ensure modern browser with localStorage support

#### Formatting Issues

**Symptoms:**

- Format button doesn't work
- Query becomes malformed after formatting

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Query Syntax**: Formatter requires valid SPARQL
2. **Try Different Formatter**: Switch between sparql-formatter and legacy in Settings
3. **Manual Formatting**: Format query manually if auto-format fails
4. **Report Invalid Results**: If formatter produces incorrect output, it's a bug

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered here:

1. **Check GitHub Issues**: Visit [YASGUI Issues](https://github.com/Matdata-eu/Yasgui/issues)
2. **Search Existing Issues**: Your problem might already be reported
3. **Create New Issue**: Provide:
   - YASGUI version
   - Browser and version
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Error messages
   - Example query (if applicable)
4. **Community Support**: Engage with the YASGUI community

### Best Practices

**For Reliable Querying:**

- Always use `LIMIT` when exploring new data
- Test complex queries incrementally
- Save important queries outside the browser
- Use meaningful tab names
- Keep YASGUI updated (if self-hosted)
- Monitor endpoint status pages
- Use appropriate query types (SELECT vs CONSTRUCT)

**For Better Performance:**

- Format queries for readability
- Use specific property paths instead of `?p`
- Add filters early in query patterns
- Avoid `SELECT *` on large datasets
- Close unused tabs
- Clear old results periodically
